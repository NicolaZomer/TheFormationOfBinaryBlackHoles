In the folder "LCP_projects_Y4-Group9", the file "project_description_astro_mapelli.pdf" describes the project and provides guidance to its development. The jupyter notebook "Project.ipynb" is the project itself. 

Datasets are stored on Google Drive (link and description in the pdf document).

## Assignment
Students are supposed to work together to produce a short report on the assigned task. The preferred format for the latter is a jupyter notebook, with the proper description, the code implemented for the purpose and the actual results (plots, tables, etc.). The notebook has to be delivered with all the cells executed and should live in a GitHib repository.
